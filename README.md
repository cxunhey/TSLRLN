# MATLAB Demo of the Hyperspectral Image Denoising Method TSLRLN

Using the code should cite the following papers:

1. C. He, L. Sun, W. Huang, et al. TSLRLN: Tensor subspace low-rank learning with non-local prior for hyperspectral image mixed denoising. Signal Processing, 2021, 184: 108060.
2. L. Sun and B. Jeon, A novel subspace spatial-spectral low rank learning method for hyperspectral denoising, 2017 IEEE Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP), St. Petersburg, FL, 2017, pp. 1-4.
